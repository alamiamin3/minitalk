# Minitalk
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
using UNIX signals.

The comminication process is  basicaly between two programs the "Client" and the "Server".

• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.

• The client takes two parameters:
   
    ◦ The server PID.
    ◦ The string to send.
